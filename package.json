  "description": "Description: Unity Project Installer is an automated tool designed to initialize your Unity project by installing essential packages (e.g., Newtonsoft.Json, VContainer, UniTask) with a single click.\\n\nIt follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern and supports both OpenUPM and Git packages, ensuring that your project is set up with all required modules.\\n\nAfter installation, the tool automatically cleans up by removing the installer package itself.\\n\n\\n\nDetailed Code Overview:\\n\n1. InstallationStateManager:\\n\n   - Manages installation state using Unity's EditorPrefs (tracking whether installation is in progress, the current package index, and the total number of packages).\\n\n   - Allows resuming installation from a previous session if the process was interrupted.\\n\n\\n\n2. PackageListManager:\\n\n   - Maintains separate lists for OpenUPM packages and Git packages.\\n\n   - Provides a combined list of all packages to install, ensuring a clear distinction between package sources.\\n\n\\n\n3. OpenUPMRegistryManager:\\n\n   - Checks and configures the manifest.json file to include the required OpenUPM registry settings.\\n\n   - Adds or updates registry entries based on the scopes derived from the OpenUPM package names.\\n\n\\n\n4. PackageInstallationTask:\\n\n   - Handles the installation of individual packages using Unityâ€™s Package Manager API (Client.Add).\\n\n   - Monitors each installation for success, failure, or timeouts, and triggers callbacks accordingly.\\n\n\\n\n5. InstallationProcessor:\\n\n   - Orchestrates the sequential installation of all packages.\\n\n   - Uses frame delays (with longer delays for Git packages) to ensure smooth processing between installations.\\n\n   - Finalizes the process by clearing the progress bar and invoking the automatic removal of the installer package.\\n\n\\n\n6. InstallerPackageRemover:\\n\n   - Automatically removes the installer package from the project after all packages have been installed.\\n\n   - Monitors the removal process to handle any errors or timeouts.\\n\n\\n\n7. PackageInstallerManager (Facade):\\n\n   - Acts as the primary entry point and user interface via Unity's Editor menu.\\n\n   - Provides menu options for starting a new installation, resuming an interrupted one, or resetting the installation state.\\n\n\\n\nUsage:\\n\nTo initialize your Unity project and install all necessary packages, select the \\\"ActFit/Project Initialize\\\" option from the Unity Editor menu. This triggers the automated process that configures the OpenUPM registry, installs packages sequentially, and performs automatic cleanup once complete.",
